### Python Face Emotion Detetor (OpenCV + Cascade Classifier)
an open-source console application developed with `Python` using `OpenCV`, `Keras` and `Cascade classifier` to train and detect seven human face emotion types as follows below:
* Angry
* Happy
* Disgust
* Sad
* Scared
* Surprised
* Neutral

## Requirements
- Python (Version >= 3.0)
- OpenCV
- tensorflow
- Keras
- imutils
- numpy

## Training
First of all, you need to  use cascade classifier method to detect human faces. we have  do that before and saved the final .xml file in order to use as your cascade source file.  
## Running
open your terminal on the project main directory and run the following terminal:
```bash
python3 ./Code/completed.py
```

## Output:
